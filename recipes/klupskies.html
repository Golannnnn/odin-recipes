    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is a family favorite that was passed down over the generations. Grandma and Pap just ate them plain, with a fork (sometimes dipped in ketchup), but our family likes to top these burgers with cheese and serve on a hamburger bun in a the traditional way. I have also seen these referred to as Kotlety Mielone. These can also be cooked on the grill. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 small onion</li>
        <li>1/2 green pepper</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/4 sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix ground beef, onion, green pepper, egg, ketchup, and sea salt together in a bowl; mix in the white bread pieces until evenly distributed. Form the mixture into 4 patties.</li>
        <li>Spray a large skillet with olive oil cooking spray and set over medium heat. Cook the burgers until well-browned on the bottoms, about 10 minutes; flip the burgers and cook until the meat is no longer pink and the juices run clear, 8 to 10 more minutes.</li>
    </ol>
